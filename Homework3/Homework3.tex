\begin{ex}[3.2.3]
	Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Conjecture a formula for \\ $A_n = \frac{1}{(1)(2)} + \frac{1}{(2)(3)} + \frac{1}{(3)(4)} + ... + \frac{1}{(n)(n+1)}$
	\\ and prove your conjecture.
\end{ex}
\begin{solution}
    Write your solutions here.
\end{solution}

\begin{ex}[3.2.4]
	Use induction to prove that every positive integer is either even or odd. Then use this result to show that every integer
	is either even or odd.
\end{ex}
\begin{solution}
    Write your solutions here.
\end{solution}

\begin{ex}[3.2.5]
	Let $m$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Define what it means to say that $m$ divides $n$. Now prove that for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, 6 divides
	$n^3-n$.
\end{ex}
\begin{solution}
    Write your solutions here.
\end{solution}

\begin{thm}[3.3.3]
	Every reducible polynomial can be written as a product of irreducible polynomials.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    Write your proof here.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}[2.28]
	Let $G= (V,E)$ be a connected graph that contains a circuit $C$. If $e$ is an edge
in $C$, then the subgraph $G^\prime= (V,E \setminus \{e\})$ is still connected.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    Write your proof here.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}[2.29]
	Let $G$ be a graph. Let $C$ be a subgraph of $G$ that consists of the vertices and edges that belong to a circuit in $G$. Then $deg_C(v)$ is 
	even for every vertex $v$ of $C$.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    Write your proof here.
\end{proof}

\begin{ex}[2.30]
	Restate the Konigsberg Bridge Problem using our formal definitions.
\end{ex}
\begin{solution}
    Write your solutions here.
\end{solution}

\begin{thm}[2.31]
	A graph $G$ has an Euler circuit if and only if it is connected and every vertex in $G$ has even, positive degree.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    Write your proof here.
\end{proof}

\begin{ex}[2.33]
	Solve the Konigsberg Bridge Problem. Write your solution in a way that Otto could understand from start to finish, that is, write your
	answer thoroughly in ordinary English, or Old Prussian, if you prefer.
\end{ex}
\begin{solution}
    Write your solutions here.
\end{solution}

\begin{ex}[2.34]
	Solve the Paperpersonâ€™s Puzzle.
\end{ex}
\begin{solution}
    Write your solutions here.
