\begin{thm}[2.51]
	Every connected graph can be created by starting with a single vertex and repeatedly adding one additional edge at a time to create increasingly larger connected subgraphs until the whole graph is created.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    Write your proof here.
\end{proof}

\begin{sch}[2.52]
	Let $G$ be a connected graph. Then $G$ can be constructed according to the previous theorem where all type (1) edges area added before any type (2) edge is added. If in addition $G$ is planar, this construction allows
	us to redraw $G$ using these techniques such that each partial drawing is also planar.
\end{sch}
\begin{proof}
    Write your proof here.
\end{proof}

\begin{ex}[2.54]
	Draw a graph using the two procedures detailed in the Constructing Connected Graphs Theorem. Create a chart that includes the number of vertices, number of edges, and number of faces at each stage. Do you notice any patterns?
\end{ex}
\begin{solution}
    Write your solutions here.
\end{solution}

\begin{thm}[2.55]
	For a connected graph $G$ drawn in the plane, $|V| - |E| + |F| = 2$.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    Write your proof here.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}[2.56]
	For a graph $G$ drawn in the plane with $n$ components, $|V| - |E| + |F| = n + 1$.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
    Write your proof here.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}[2.58]
	If $G$ is a tree with $n$ vertices, then $G$ has $n - 1$ edges.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
    Write your proof here.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}[2.61]
	The graph $K_5$ is not planar.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
    Write your proof here.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}[2.63]
	Any planar graph with no loops or multiple edges has a vertex of degree at most 5.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    Write your proof here.
\end{proof}

\begin{ex}[2.64]
	Theorem $2.63$ requires all of its hypotheses, of which there are three. For each hypothesis, find a counterexample to the theorem if that hypothesis were removed.
\end{ex}
\begin{solution}
    Write your solutions here.
\end{solution}

\begin{thm}[2.65]
	The graph $K_{3,3}$ is not planar.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    Write your proof here.
\end{proof}
