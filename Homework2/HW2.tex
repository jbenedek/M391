\begin{ex}[2.13]
	Determine whether the following data could represent a graph. For each data set that \textit{can} represent a graph, determine \textit{all} the possible graphs that it could be, describe each graph using pictures
	and set notation, and explain why you list is complete. If no graph can exist with the given properties, state why not. 
	\begin{enumerate} 
	  \item $V = \{v,w,x,y\}$ with $deg(v) = 2$ , $deg(w) = 1$, $deg(x) = 5$, $deg(y) = 0$
          \item $V = \{a,b,c,d\}$ with $deg(a) = 1$, $deg(b) = 4$, $deg(c) = 2$, $deg(d) = 2$
          \item $V = \{v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4\}$ with $deg(v_1) = 1$, $deg(v_2) = 3$, $deg(v_3) = 2$, $deg(v_4) = 5$
       \end{enumerate}

\begin{ex}[2.14]
	If you are given a finite set $V$ and a nonnegative integer for each element in the set such that the sum of these integers is even, can $V$ be realized as the vertices of a graph with the associated degrees? 
	If so, prove it. If not, give a counter-example.
\end{ex}
\begin{solution}
    Write your solutions here.
\end{solution}

\begin{ex}[2.20]
	Draw all graphs with four edges without loops or vertices with degree 0. Argue that your list is complete. Which graphs with four edges are traceable (with and without returning to the start)? 
	Try to be systematic and try to isolate some principles that seem pertinent to traceability.

\begin{thm}[2.22]
	Let $G$ be a garph that has a walk between vertices $v$ and $w$. Then $G$ has a walk between vertices $v$ and $w$ that does not use repeated edges. \end{thm}

\begin{proof}
    Write your proof here.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}[2.23]
	Let $G$ be a graph and $W: v_0, e_1, ..., e_n, v_n$ a walk in $G$ such that the vertices $v_i$ are all distinct. Then $W$ has no repeated edges. \end{thm}

\begin{proof}
    Write your proof here.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}[2.25]
	Let $G$ be a graph with vertices $u$, $v$, and $w$. 
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item The vertex $v$ is connected to itself. 
	  \item If $u$ is connected to $v$ and $v$ is connected to $w$, then $u$ is connected to $w$.
	  \item If $v$ is connected to $w$, then $w$ is connected to $v$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
    Write your proof here.
